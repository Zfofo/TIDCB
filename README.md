# TIDCB:Text Image Dangerous-Scene Convolutional Baseline

# Abstract
- The automatic management of public area safety stands as one of the most challenging issues in our society. For instance, the timely evacuation of the public during incidents such as fires or large-scale shootings is of paramount importance. However, detecting pedestrian behavior indicative of danger in a timely manner from extensive video surveillance data may not always be feasible. This may result in untimely warnings being provided, resulting in significant loss of life. Although existing research has proposed "text-based person search," it has primarily focused on pedestrian search by matching image of pedestrian body part to text, lacking the search for pedestrians in dangerous scenarios.  To address this gap, this paper proposes an innovative warning framework that further searches for individuals in dangerous situations based on textual descriptions, aiming to prevent or mitigate crisis events. We have constructed a new public safety dataset named CHUK-PEDES-DANGER, which is one of the first pedestrian dataset including dangerous scenes. Additionally, we introduce a novel framework for public automatic evacuation. This framework leverages a multimodal deep learning architecture that combines the image model ResNet-50 with the text model RoBERTa to produce our Text-Image Dangerous-Scene Convolutional Baseline (TIDCB) model, which addresses the classification problem from text to image and image to text by matching images of pedestrian body parts and environments to text. We also propose a novel loss function, cross-modal projection matching-triplet (CMPM-Triplet). After conducting extensive experiments, we have validated that our method demonstrates a significant improvement in accuracy. Our model outperforms TIPCB with a matching rate of 76.93%, an improvement of 4.78% compared to TIPCB, and demonstrates significant advantages in handling complex scenarios.
  
# Dataset
- We made a dataset called CUHK-PEDES-DANGER just for public safety. It is an improvement on the CUHK-PEDES dataset.To summarize, our recently created CUHK-PEDES-DANGER dataset comprises 2385 unique pedestrians, 19080 pictures, and 38160 textual descriptions.
